# CSC14005_Project  

This project involves implementing Machine Learning models based on the **CIFAR-10** dataset  
([link](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)) using three well-known ML libraries:  

- **PyTorch**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- **Scikit-learn**
- **JAX**

Once the implementations are completed, the models will be evaluated on the dataset based on the following criteria:  

- **Accuracy**  
- **Time and space usage**  

These criteria will serve as real-world data for further comparison and analysis.
